# Getting started.


So, I made this supprisingly using Linux. Ubuntu 22.04 Jammy specificly.

You will need these dependcies:
* libguesfs-tools
* A Cosmos OS Linux Installation as well as VSCode & dotnet.
* (Optional) Fish + Tmux for better development.

I have made 4 shell scripts, they are:  
* [run.sh](/docs/scripts/run.md);
* [ex.sh](/docs/scripts/ex.md);
* [editFS.sh](/docs/scripts/editFS.md);
* [packFS.sh](/docs/scripts/packFS.sh);
